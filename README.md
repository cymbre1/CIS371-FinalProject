# Project Description
This project is a home chore scheduling app that will schedule chores that need to be done however often in order to distribute household workload.

It will incorporate a calendar aspect in order to allow the user to schedule tasks around events such as going on vacation and be able to see the predicted schedule.

The app will include user login and identification in order to identify users and will collect email and household information in order to notify users about tasks.

The app will have a household feature so that multiple people in the same household can be assigned separate tasks.
